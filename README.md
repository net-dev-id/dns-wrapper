# Boiler plate for C++ projects

This is a boiler plate for C++ projects. What you get:

-   Sources, headers and mains separated in distinct folders
-   Use of modern [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for much easier compiling
-   Setup for tests using [doctest](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest)
-   Continuous testing with [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/), [Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), with support for C++17.
-   Code coverage reports, including automatic upload to [Coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/) and/or [Codecov.io](https://codecov.io)
-   Code documentation with [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/)

## Building

Build by making a build directory (i.e. `build/`), run `cmake` in that dir, and then use `make` to build the desired target.

Example:

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -S. -Bbuild
make -C build
./build/dns-wrapper --config-file config/config.ini
make test      # Makes and runs the tests.
make coverage  # Generate a coverage report.
make doc       # Generate html documentation.
```
